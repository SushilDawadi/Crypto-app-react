learning react 


I am currently engaged in developing a Crypto app where I am focused on expanding my knowledge of React and delving deeper into the concepts of useState hook, useEffect hook, and Axios. These technologies enable seamless communication with APIs in the React project, facilitating the retrieval of data. Additionally, I am exploring async/await for smoother data fetching and integrating the CoinGecko API to access cryptocurrency-related information for the application.
